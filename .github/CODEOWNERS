# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches javascript files, only these owners
# will be requested to review.

# For example:
#  *.js    @octocat @github/js

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer.
